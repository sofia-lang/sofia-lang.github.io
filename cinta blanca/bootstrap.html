                        Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email,
                        and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the Bootstrap Institute library.

                        While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program,
                        "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each
                        node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data
                        machines under SINTRAN-III. See: Enquire user manual as scanned images or as HTML page(alt).

                        Tim starts work on a hypertext GUI browser+editor using the NeXTStep development environment. He
                        makes up "WorldWideWeb" as a name for the program. (See the first browser screenshot) "World
